# Need money to help with COVID-19?

**Last updated: March 24, 2020**

Find out what financial help is available for people who have stopped working. If you are eligible for Employment Insurance, either Regular, Sickness or Caregiver benefits, apply for those first. The emergency programs are for people who are not eligible for EI.

If your employer is still paying you while you’re at home, do not apply for benefits.

Regardless of your employment situation, you could receive one-time payments in May to help offset costs of the COVID-19 crisis. Details are at the end of this information.
